Welcome: Test your intuition and logic in this exciting challenge where each level pushes your guessing skills to the limit.

Navigate Menu: The setting option allows the player to toggle the UI to dark/light theme to change the UI experience. The new game option creates a new game instance for the user.

Navigate level panel: Allows the user to track back through the sublevels and challenges elements they already completed and shows current active sublevel item with an indication '>' behind the sublevel label. The level panel also shows any upcoming sublelvel items and challenges. The user can return back to that sublevel item by click on the item and viewing the instance made that sublevel item. Each level element is toggleble allowing the user to collapse each element as they wish. In addition the level panel displays a return to main menu button which returns the user back to the main menu.   

Navigate history panel: Allows the user to track back through all the changes made that sublevel item. Each history element contains: toggle button (the collapse function for the history element), remove button (which removes the history item from the history panel) and a time label (Which displays the time the history element was done being made or edited). Each subhistory item allows the user to edit the number displayed on the subhistory item and each subhistory item contains button called '?' (hint buttons) that shows what points were earned when the subhistory item was created through the tooltip. When the subhistory item gets edited the '?' (hint button) buttons change to show what new points get earned this time. The only time the user stop earning points is when the user guesses the number correctly and the '?' (hint button) defaults to show that the correct number was already guessed if any new changes or new history elements are made.

Navigate hint buttons: When the suhistory item number is correct the color of the button will be 'Azure' once, if any other attempts after the correct number was found, only one hint button with the color 'ArtyClick Magenta' will show. If the correct number was not found look for any of the following thresholds: If a correct digit is found and it has the correct location within the randomly generated number a hint button will show 'Dark Mint Green', If a digit exists within the randomly generated number but wrong location expect 'La Salle Green', If a digit in the correct location and it has the same property (even/odd) expect 'Lightning Yellow', If duplicate digit is found within the randomly generated number expect 'Coral Red' and finally if a prime digit state in the correct location exists expect 'Rich Lilac'. If no points were added this time expect 'Gray'. 

Navigate center panel: Depending on the item accessed, the center panel can either show a challenge level UI or sublevel UI. The sublevel UI shows the current sublevel's level on the top via level label. The points label shows the amount of points earned that sublevel instance and the code display shows the hashed value of the randomized number unless the correct number was found that session, then it will display the full encrypted number. The user display shows the number the user is currently inputting. The button number display shows numbers through 0-9 including 'C' (clear button) and '<-' (black button). The 'C' (clear button) clears the full user display and adds a new history element to the history panel. 'B' (black button) adds a new subhistory item to the history element. It only get's displayed as soon as the user finishes that session by pressing the 'C' (clear button).

Navigate Points Calculated: 1.00 multiplied by the level in points if the number is correct. 0.50 - The guessed digit is exactly correct in both value and position. 0.25 - The guessed digit exists in the target number but is in the wrong spot. 0.10 - The guessed digit matches the property of the digit in the randomly generated number. (even/odd). 0.05 - The guessed digit appears more than once in the target number. 0.01 - The starting digit in the guess number is the same as the starting digit in the randomly generated number.
